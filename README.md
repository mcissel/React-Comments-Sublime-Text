# React-Comments-Sublime-Text
Very basic comments for JSX HTML tags

Install
============

Navigate to your packages folder (~user\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages) and clone.

`git clone https://github.com/mcissel/React-Comments-Sublime-Text.git React\ Comments`


Usage
============

Toggle on and off the `{/*` and `*/}` style JSX comments. Pretty basic.


Keybindings
============

This uses the standard comment keybinding `ctrl+/` in Windows and Linux, `super+forward_slash` in OSX.

I haven't tested it in OSX or Linux, so let me know if it's not working. Meanwhile, you can map the `react_comments` command to a different key combo if it's not working for you.
